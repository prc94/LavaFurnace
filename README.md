# LavaFurnace
LavaFurnace Minecraft Mod (made for fun)

This mod adds a furnace that runs on lava (WOW! WHAT A SURPRISE!!)

Normal vanilla furnace can run on lava to for sure, but here we have a whole different approach.
There are 3 major differences from vanilla furnace:
1. This one does not need fuel to be put inside it, lava is placed as a block right beneath the appliance
2. It can run FOREVER!! it needs no refuel or any additional handling, just place lava beneath and enjoy
3. It smells stuff 2 times slower

I made this mod quite a while ago when I was learning basics of the Minecraft Modding.

Hope it will be somehow useful for anyone.
Have fun.
